**ButtonFlow** is a lightweight, performance-optimized WordPress plugin designed to add a sticky floating "Call to Action" (CTA) button to websites, specifically for mobile devices. It aims to solve "lead leaks" for local businesses by ensuring a primary contact action (Call, WhatsApp, Booking URL, or Smooth Scroll) is always within thumb-reach as a user scrolls.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Click-to-Call** — Tapping the button instantly dials your phone number.
- **WhatsApp Integration** — Opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled, customizable message.
- **Booking & External URLs** — Send visitors directly to your booking page or any external link.
- **Smooth Scroll** — Scrolls the page to a specific section using an anchor ID (#contact).
- **Live Preview** — See exactly how your button looks in real-time as you edit settings in the admin dashboard.
- **Mobile-Only Display** — Zero desktop bloat. Hidden on screens > 767px via CSS and JS dual-enforcement.
- **Page-Level Exclusion** — Easily hide the button on specific pages using slugs or IDs.
- **Performance Optimized** — Sub-5kb total asset size with zero external dependencies (No jQuery, No React).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **PHP:** 8.0+ (Namespaced, Object-Oriented, Manual PSR-4 Autoloading).
- **WordPress:** 6.5+ (Utilizes Settings API and Frontend Footer Injection).
- **JavaScript:** Vanilla ES6 (Dependency-free for maximum performance).
- **CSS:** Vanilla CSS3 (Flexbox for positioning, CSS variables for dynamic styling).
- **Composer:** Used for development dependencies and quality control (PHPCS/WPCS).
