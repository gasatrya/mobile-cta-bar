Boost conversions with a permanent floating CTA button on mobile. One tap to call, message, or book. Zero code required.

== Description ==

65–75% of local business website traffic comes from mobile — yet most WordPress themes bury the phone number in the header and hide the "Book Now" button at the top of the page. Once a visitor scrolls, your most important CTA disappears.

**MobiFlow** fixes this in minutes.

Install the plugin, set your button label and action, and a beautiful floating button will appear at the bottom of every mobile screen — staying permanently visible as the user scrolls. One tap to call. One tap to book. One tap to start a WhatsApp conversation.

No page builder. No theme editing. No code.

= Who is this for? =

* Aesthetic clinics & medspas
* Restaurants & cafes
* Law firms & consultants
* Real estate agents
* Any local business that gets mobile traffic and wants more leads

= Core Features =

* **Click-to-Call** — Tapping the button instantly dials your phone number.
* **Open URL** — Send visitors directly to your booking page, menu, or any link.
* **WhatsApp Chat** — Opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message (fully customizable).
* **Smooth Scroll** — Scrolls the page to a specific section using an anchor ID (#contact).
* **Custom Label & Icon** — Set any button text and choose from preset icons (phone, calendar, WhatsApp, message).
* **Appearance Control** — Customize background color, text color, and choose from 3 button sizes (Small, Medium, Large).
* **Live Preview** — See exactly how your button looks in real-time as you edit the settings.
* **Mobile-Only Display** — The button is never shown on tablets or desktops (CSS + JS dual enforcement).
* **Page-Level Hide Rules** — Suppress the button on specific pages (e.g., the contact page itself) using slugs or IDs.
* **Entrance Animation** — Button slides up from the bottom after a configurable delay.
* **Performance Optimized** — Total asset size under 5kb. No jQuery. No React. No bloat.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this button show on desktop? =

No. The button is hidden on all screens wider than 767px using both CSS media queries and JavaScript. Desktop visitors will never see it.

= Does it work with Elementor, Divi, or Astra? =

Yes. The plugin injects directly into the page footer and is fully theme-agnostic. It has been tested with Astra, GeneratePress, OceanWP, and Elementor-based themes.

= Can I hide the button on specific pages? =

Yes. In the settings page, you can enter a comma-separated list of page IDs or slugs where the button should be hidden (for example: your contact page or checkout page).

= How do I set up the WhatsApp action? =

Select "WhatsApp" as the action type, then enter your phone number in international format (e.g., `628123456789`). You can also customize the pre-filled message text.

= Is this plugin free? =

Yes. The core plugin is 100% free and always will be. A Pro version with advanced features is planned for a future release.

= Will it slow down my site? =

No. The CSS and JS files combined weigh less than 5kb and are only loaded on the frontend. The plugin uses no external dependencies.
